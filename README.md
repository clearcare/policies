# Cloudticity HIPAA Compliance Policies

HIPAA compliance is complicated but it doesn't have to be. Cloudticity helps relieve the technical burden with our HIPAA-compliant cloud computing platform and solutions for healthcare.

In an effort to make compliance as easy as possible for companies working with protected health information (PHI), we decided to open source our company policies.

Do you handle PHI and not yet have your own company policies in place? Then you'll find our content useful.
