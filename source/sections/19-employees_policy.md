## 19.3 Issue Escalation

Cloudticity workforce members are to escalate issues to the Chief Executive Officer.

Security incidents, particularly those involving ePHI, are handled using the process described in [§11.2](11-incident_response_policy.md#112-incident-management-policies). If the incident involves a breach of ePHI, the Security Officer will manage the incident using the process described in [§12.2](12-breach_policy.md#122-cloudticity-breach-policy). Refer to [§11.2](11-incident_response_policy.md#112-incident-management-policies) for a list of sample items that can trigger Cloudticity's incident response procedures; if you are unsure whether the issue is a security incident, contact the Security Officer immediately.

It is the duty of the CEO to follow the process outlined below:

1. Create a private task in the Teamwork project: Compliance Review Activity (CRA).
2. The task is investigated, documented, and, when a conclusion or remediation is reached, it is assigned to another workforce member for review.
3. The task is reviewed by the other workforce member. If the task is rejected, it goes back for further evaluation and review.
4. If the task is approved, it is marked as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
5. The workforce member that initiated the process is notified of the outcome.
